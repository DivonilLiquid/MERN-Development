# Course Material and FAQ for my Complete Node.js, Express and MongoDB Bootcamp

This repo contains starter files and the finished project files for all the projects of my MERN DEVELOPMENT (complete repo size is **288MB**).

Use starter code to start each section, and **final code to compare it with your own code whenever something doesn't work**!


## FAQ

### Q1: How do I download the files?

**A:** If you're new to GitHub and just want to download the entire code, hit the green button saying "Code", and then choose the "Download ZIP" option.

### Q2: I'm stuck in one of the projects. Where do I get help?

**A:** Have you actually tried to fix the problem on your own? Have you compared your code to the final code? If you failed fixing your problem.


### Q3: Can I see a final version of the course projects?

**A:** Absolutely! The main project is [Natours](https://www.natours.dev/) (it even got its own domain ðŸ˜Ž). You can log in with `laura@example.com` and password `test1234`. There is also an API at `/api`, with [documentation available here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4237486/S1LwxnaE?version=latest) (incomplete). The small Node.js introduction project is [Node Farm](https://node-farm.herokuapp.com/).


### Q4: Do you accept pull requests?

**A:** No, for the simple reason that I want this repository to contain the _exact_ same code that is shown in the videos. However, please feel free to add an issue if you found one.
